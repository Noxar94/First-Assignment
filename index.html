  What did i do after school?

</h3>

<p class="paragrath-text">
  When i finnished school i tried a few jobs like in the industries and stuff but didnt find anything i was fit for, 
  so i started moving around to try new things. 
  
  I started by moving up to my sister in norway, 
  got a job as a vip driver for the artist Wardruna (the ones who made music in the tv-series "Vikings")
  this was really cool! They were awesome, so nice and really fun to talk to. 
  <br>
  even though i struggled with the language.
  <br>
  After this i worked for a while as a electrician but i was feeling that i dont really enjoy living in norway,
  away from all my friends and family.
  I picked up my stuff packed my car and moved on a month later.
